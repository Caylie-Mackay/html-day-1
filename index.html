<h2>My name is Caylie Mackay</h2>

<span>learning to code</span>
<span>has been an adventure so far!</span>
<p>The hardest part is just remembering all the commands.<br/>There is one command thats easy to remember though!</p>
<pre>&lt;h1&gt;This will create the largest heading&lt;h1&gt;</pre>
<p>But now when im not writing code I devote my time to watching tv!</p>
<h3>And thats all about me!</h3>
